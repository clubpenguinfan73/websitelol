# ðŸš€ Git Commands to Push to GitHub

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository First
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `my-gaming-profile` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it Public
4. **DON'T** initialize with README
5. Click "Create repository"
6. **Copy the repository URL** (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/my-gaming-profile.git)

## Step 2: Use These Commands

```bash
# Remove existing git history (if any)
rm -rf .git

# Initialize new git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete gaming profile with Discord/Spotify integration"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPONAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Replace the URL
In the command above, replace:
- `YOURUSERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOURREPONAME` with your repository name

**Example:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/john123/my-gaming-profile.git
```

## Complete Command Sequence

git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete gaming profile with Discord/Spotify integration"
