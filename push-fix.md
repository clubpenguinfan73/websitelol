# Quick Fix for Live Site

## Current Status
- Your API is working perfectly at `https://renegaderaider.wtf/.netlify/functions/api/profile`
- The live site shows "Loading..." because it's using an old version
- Your local changes are 1 commit ahead and need to be pushed

## Manual Push Instructions

Since automatic push failed, please push manually:

1. **Option 1: Use Replit's Version Control**
   - Click the "Version Control" tab in the left sidebar
   - Click "Push to origin" or "Sync"

2. **Option 2: Use the Shell**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## What Will Happen
Once pushed, Netlify will automatically:
- Build your updated frontend
- Deploy the new version
- Your site will show the proper profile and links instead of "Loading..."

## Current Working Features
- ✅ API returning correct profile data
- ✅ JavaScript errors fixed
- ✅ Responsive design ready
- ✅ Admin panel access working

Just need to push the latest changes to see it live!
