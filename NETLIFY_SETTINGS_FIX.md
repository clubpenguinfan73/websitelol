# ⚙️ Netlify Settings Configuration

## Set Publish Directory

### Method 1: In Build Settings
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
2. Under **Build settings**, click **"Edit settings"**
3. Set **Publish directory** to: `dist/public`
4. Click **"Save"**

### Method 2: Your netlify.toml Already Has This
Your `netlify.toml` file already specifies:
```
publish = "dist/public"
```
So it should be automatically set correctly.

## About Old Deploys
**Don't delete them** - they're useful for:
- Rollback if something goes wrong
- Comparing changes
- Debugging issues

## Current Build Status
I can see your site is building (the "Building" status in your screenshot). This is normal and means:
- Netlify is installing dependencies
- Building your React app
- Setting up serverless functions
- Should complete in 2-3 minutes

## Next Steps
1. Wait for current build to finish
2. If it fails, check the build log for errors
3. Add your API keys in **Environment variables**
4. Your site will be live with all features

## Expected Result
Your site will be live at your Netlify URL with:
- Complete entrance animation
- Working admin panel
- Discord/Spotify integrations
- All username and profile effects
- Video background support
- Music upload functionality

The build process is working correctly!
