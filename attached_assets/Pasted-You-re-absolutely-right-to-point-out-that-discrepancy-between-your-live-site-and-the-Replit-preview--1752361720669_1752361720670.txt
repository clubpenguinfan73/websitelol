You're absolutely right to point out that discrepancy between your live site and the Replit preview. This is the core problem we've been trying to solve for Spotify.

Based on the Netlify Function logs you provided in our last interaction, we now have a very clear picture:

  * **Spotify API Initialization:** Your Netlify logs show `INFO Spotify API initialized with: { clientId: 'Set', clientSecret: 'Set', refreshToken: 'Set' }`. This means your Netlify Functions are successfully pulling your Spotify environment variables (Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh Token) and using them to set up the Spotify API client. This is good progress.

  * **The Problem:** Despite successful initialization, your browser console on the live site still reports a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` from a "Spotify API error". This means your Netlify Function, *after* initializing, is making a request to the Spotify API (or an intermediary service), and instead of receiving valid JSON data about the currently playing song, it's getting an HTML error page back. Your frontend then tries to parse this HTML as JSON, leading to the `SyntaxError`.

### Why this happens (Preview vs. Live):

The most common reasons for getting an HTML error page from a service (like Spotify's API) when you expect JSON are:

1.  **Authentication Failure:** Even if your client/secret are 'Set', the actual `refreshToken` or the process of obtaining an `accessToken` from it might be failing when your Netlify function makes the request to Spotify. Spotify's API will return an error (often a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden) as an HTML page if the authentication is invalid. This is highly probable.
2.  **Incorrect Redirect URI:** If your Spotify app's redirect URI on the Spotify Developer Dashboard does not precisely match the redirect URI your live Netlify site is using, authentication will fail.
3.  **Rate Limiting/API Errors from Spotify:** Less common for consistent errors, but possible if you're hitting the API too frequently or there's a temporary issue on Spotify's side.
4.  **Backend Logic Error:** Your Netlify Function's code, after initializing the Spotify API, might have a bug in how it constructs the request, handles the response, or processes the data from Spotify.

### **What to do to Fix Spotify "Nothing Playing":**

The fix lies in debugging your Netlify Function's interaction with the Spotify API itself.

1.  **Examine your Spotify-related Netlify Function Code:**

      * Find the specific part of your Netlify Function that makes the actual HTTP request to Spotify's API to get the currently playing song (or to refresh tokens).
      * **Add detailed `console.log` statements around this request.** This is the crucial step to pinpoint the exact failure.
          * Log the **full URL** that your function is trying to hit on Spotify's API.
          * Log the **headers** being sent with the request (especially the `Authorization` header, but *do not log the actual access token* for security, just confirm it's present).
          * **After receiving the response:**
              * Log the `response.status` (e.g., 200, 401, 403, 500).
              * Log the **`response.text()`** (the raw, unparsed body of the response). This is key, as it will show you the HTML that your code is incorrectly trying to parse as JSON.

    Here's an example of where to add these logs:

    ```javascript
    // Inside your Spotify Netlify Function (e.g., spotify-activity.js or similar)

    // ... (your existing setup and initialization for Spotify API) ...

    exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
        // ...
        try {
            // Assume you have an accessToken here (either from refresh or direct auth)
            // If you have a refresh token flow, ensure it's successfully getting a new accessToken first.
            const accessToken = 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'; // This needs to be dynamically fetched/managed

            const currentlyPlayingUrl = 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing'; // Or similar endpoint

            console.log(`[Spotify Function] Attempting to fetch: ${currentlyPlayingUrl}`);
            console.log(`[Spotify Function] Using Access Token: ${accessToken ? 'PRESENT' : 'NOT PRESENT'}`);

            const spotifyResponse = await fetch(currentlyPlayingUrl, {
                headers: {
                    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
            });

            console.log(`[Spotify Function] Spotify API Status: ${spotifyResponse.status}`);
            const rawResponseBody = await spotifyResponse.text();
            console.log(`[Spotify Function] Spotify API Raw Response:`, rawResponseBody);

            // This is the line that's likely failing if rawResponseBody is HTML
            const spotifyData = JSON.parse(rawResponseBody);

            // ... (rest of your logic to process spotifyData) ...

            return {
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify(spotifyData),
            };

        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`[Spotify Function] Error during API call:`, error);
            return {
                statusCode: 500,
                body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to retrieve Spotify data', details: error.message }),
            };
        }
    };
    ```

2.  **Redeploy and Check Netlify Function Logs:**

      * After adding these `console.log` statements to your Spotify Netlify Function, push your code to trigger a new Netlify deploy.
      * Go to your live site, refresh, and wait for the Spotify "Nothing Playing" state to appear (which means the function ran).
      * **Go to your Netlify Dashboard -\> Your Site -\> Functions.**
      * **Click on your Spotify-related function.**
      * **Examine the latest logs carefully.** The new `console.log` statements will reveal the exact HTTP status code and the full raw HTML response body that Spotify is sending back. This will tell us *why* Spotify is rejecting the request.

Once you provide those detailed logs from the Spotify function, we'll know exactly what Spotify is responding with and can address the authentication or request issue directly.
