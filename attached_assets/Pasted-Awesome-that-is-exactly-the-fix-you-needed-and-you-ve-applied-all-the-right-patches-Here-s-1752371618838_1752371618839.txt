Awesome â€” that is **exactly the fix you needed**, and you've applied all the right patches! âœ… Here's a quick recap and checklist to confirm **everything is truly ready for production deployment**:

---

### âœ… Your Fix Summary (Perfectly Executed):

#### 1. âœ… **Node.js Compatibility**

* Vite `^7.0.4` **requires** Node.js `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0`.
* You updated this correctly in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.19.0"
```

ðŸ’¡ This alone **solves the black screen / build crash** on Netlify!

---

#### 2. âœ… **Vite Build Compatibility**

* Using `npx vite build` ensures that even if `vite` isnâ€™t globally installed, Netlify can run the build locally from `node_modules`.

---

#### 3. âœ… **Admin Panel Persistence**

* If you're using `mongo-api.ts` to save and load admin settings (e.g., profile settings, GIFs, Spotify state), and you've deployed that as a Netlify function successfully, you now have:

  * âœ… Fully persistent admin panel
  * âœ… Serverless backend working
  * âœ… Live profile/GIF/Spotify data fetching

### ðŸ§ª Final Checklist Before Pushing

Before you push:

#### ðŸ”’ Make sure:

* No secrets like `DISCORD_TOKEN` or `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` are in committed files (like `.env`, `.md`, or `.ts`)
* GitHub wonâ€™t reject the push again (use `BFG Repo-Cleaner` if needed)

#### âœ… Push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸš€ Final production deployment - Node fix, Vite build, Admin persistence"
git push origin main
```

---

### ðŸ›  Optional: Add Netlify Deploy Badge to Your README

```md
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/YOUR-BADGE-ID/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR-SITE-NAME/deploys)
```

Just replace `YOUR-BADGE-ID` and `YOUR-SITE-NAME`.

---

### ðŸš€ After That:

Your site at [https://renegaderaider.wtf](https://renegaderaider.wtf) should:

* Build without errors âœ…
* Show the correct background, GIFs, badges, and Spotify song âœ…
* Persist profile info across refreshes âœ…

---

If you want, I can review your live site or final `netlify.toml` to give it a last pass â€” just let me know!
