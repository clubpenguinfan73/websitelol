Awesome, thanks for sharing your repo ðŸ“¦! To dive in and realistically address your issues, here's what I'd focus on:

---

### âœ… 1. **Badges not displaying**

Check if you're using the `public_flags` from the Discord user JSON. If that's missing, your badge logic won't run. If it *is* there, verify your UI code uses a mapping like:

```js
const FLAGS = {
  DISCORD_EMPLOYEE: 1,
  PARTNERED_SERVER_OWNER: 2,
  // etc...
};

function getBadges(publicFlags) {
  return Object.entries(FLAGS)
    .filter(([,flag]) => (publicFlags & flag) === flag)
    .map(([name]) => name);
}
```

Then render icons for those badges.

### ðŸŽ§ 2. **Spotify status not showing**

If you're fetching the profile via OAuth2 or REST API, Spotify info won't show here. That's only available via the **gateway presence event** â€” meaning:

* You need a Discord **bot with Presence Intent enabled**
* The bot must be in the **same server** as your user
* You must use Discord.js or a WebSocket gateway to listen for `presenceUpdate` events and extract Spotify details
* The Spotify info will appear inside the `activities` list (look for `type: "LISTENING"` and `name: "Spotify"`)

If you're not running a bot and gateway connection, that explains why you see "Playing Discord" instead of "Playing \[song] on Spotify."

### ðŸŽ¨ 3. **GIFs not working as PFP/background**

Look at how you handle image uploads and previews. You need to:

* Ensure your file input accepts `.gif` (e.g., `accept="image/*,image/gif"`)
* Preview using `<img src="...gif">` or `background-image: url(...)`
* Double-check that your CSS doesnâ€™t inadvertently treat GIFs like static images (e.g., converting them to PNG)
* Log the MIME type and check console to see if `.gif` is filtered out

### âœ… Recommended next steps:

1. Could you locate:

   * The code handling Twitter or Discord badge rendering?
   * The part where you fetch or listen for user presence?
   * The portion handling file uploads (PFP/background)?

   I can help correct those directly.

2. If you want me to submit a quick PR for badges, GIF support, and Spotify presence logic, I can do that too.

Let me know which file(s) to focus on or if you want a full PRâ€”happy to help!
