Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step, in-depth guide** to resolve your repeated Netlify deploy failures for your repository: **[https://github.com/clubpenguinfan73/websitelol](https://github.com/clubpenguinfan73/websitelol)**

---

### 1. ‚úÖ Confirm `vite` is installed

Your deploy logs show:

```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

So Netlify can't find Vite.

* Open **`package.json`**.
* Ensure you have:

  ```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^4.0.0",
    // ‚Ä¶
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ‚Ä¶"
  }
  ```
* If `vite` is **missing**, install it:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev vite
  ```
* **Commit** both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, then push to GitHub.

### 2. üîß Adjust Netlify‚Äôs build settings

Netlify likely is running `npm run build`, but defaults to wrong publish folder (e.g., `build/`):

1. Go to **Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Continuous Deployment ‚Üí Build Settings**:

   * **Build command**: `npm run build`
   * **Publish directory**: `dist`

2. Or set this in `netlify.toml` at your project root:

   ```toml
   [build]
     command   = "npm run build"
     publish   = "dist"
     functions = "netlify/functions"
   ```

3. For Single Page App behavior, add routing redirects:

   ```toml
   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

This ensures Netlify picks the right build folder. ([answers.netlify.com][1], [docs.netlify.com][2], [netlify.com][3], [github.com][4])

### 3. üìÑ Review your build command structure

Based on your logs, your script:

```bash
vite build && esbuild server/index.ts ‚Ä¶ && mkdir -p dist/functions && npx esbuild ‚Ä¶
```

Ensure both `vite build` and your `esbuild server/index.ts` commands complete successfully **locally**:

```bash
npm run build
```

* Check if `dist/` is created.
* Validate `dist/functions/` content after functions build.
* If any step fails locally, fix before redeploy.

---

### 4. üîÑ Redeploy steps

Once your above fixes are committed:

1. Push to GitHub.
2. In Netlify dashboard, redeploy the production branch.
3. Carefully monitor logs to confirm:

   * `vite` is detected
   * Build completes generating `dist/`
   * Netlify publishes `dist/` as the site root.

---

### 5. üß© Optional: Use Netlify CLI for local test

Simulate exactly what Netlify runs:

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify init     # sets up build/publish settings
netlify build   # simulates deploy
netlify deploy --prod  # test live
```

This helps catch misconfigurations before pushing. ([github.com][4], [github.com][5])

### ‚úçÔ∏è Quick Summary

| Step | Action                                                               |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Install `"vite"` as a dev dependency and commit files                |
| 2    | Ensure build script includes `vite build`                            |
| 3    | Set Netlify‚Äôs **Publish directory** to `dist` (UI or `netlify.toml`) |
| 4    | Add SPA redirect rule if using client-side routing                   |
| 5    | Rebuild locally; then redeploy                                       |
| 6    | (Optional) Use `netlify build` to test pre-push                      |

### ‚úÖ TL;DR

Your deploy fails because `vite` isn't installed, and Netlify is looking for the wrong publish directory. Fix:

* Install and commit Vite.
* Set publish folder to `dist`.
* Add redirect for SPAs.
* Redeploy and verify success.
