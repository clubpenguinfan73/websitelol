Great observation ‚Äî and you‚Äôre **totally right to question this.** Your site is currently using `public_flags` from the Discord API, which **does not include Nitro, Boosting, or Quest badges**. That‚Äôs why you're seeing only:

* `hypesquad_events`
* `bug_hunter_level_1`
* `early_supporter`
* `active_developer`

### üîç Why you're not seeing:

| **Badge**    | **Why it's missing**                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nitro**    | Nitro status is *not* part of `public_flags`.     |
| **Boosting** | Only visible to bots in a shared server with you. |
| **Quest**    | This is **not a public badge** in `public_flags`. |

---

## ‚úÖ How to Actually Fix It

You need to either:

### Option 1: **Invite your bot to your server**

So it can access **`premium_type`**, **guild boosting**, and possibly activity like **quests**.

1. Go to [OAuth2 Generator](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Add `bot` and `guilds.members.read` scopes.
3. Generate the bot invite URL and invite it to a test server that you're in.

Then in your backend code:

```ts
const premiumStatus = user.premium_type;
// 1 = Nitro Classic, 2 = Nitro
```

---

### Option 2: **Use `flags + premium_type` + fallback logic**

Here‚Äôs a better structure:

```ts
function getBadges(user: any) {
  const flags = user.public_flags || 0;
  const badges = [];

  if (flags & (1 << 2)) badges.push({ name: 'HypeSquad Events', icon: '...' });
  if (flags & (1 << 3)) badges.push({ name: 'Bug Hunter L1', icon: '...' });
  if (flags & (1 << 9)) badges.push({ name: 'Early Supporter', icon: '...' });
  if (flags & (1 << 22)) badges.push({ name: 'Active Developer', icon: '...' });

  if (user.premium_type === 1 || user.premium_type === 2) {
    badges.push({ name: 'Nitro', icon: 'https://.../nitro.svg' });
  }

  return badges;
}
```

> You will need to **include `premium_type`** in your `/api/discord/profile` route.

## üöß Still Missing Quest or Boosting Badges?

These are **not exposed in the public Discord API**. You‚Äôd need a **guild-level bot** with `GUILD_MEMBERS` privileged intent and a shared server.

If you want to track boosting/quests:

* Add the bot to a server you own
* Enable **Presence** + **Members** intents
* Use `/guilds/{guild.id}/members/{user.id}` endpoint (requires bot auth)
* Parse `premium_since` to detect boosts

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* You're seeing only public flags, not Nitro/Boost/Quest because they're **not part of `public_flags`**
* **Fix:** Add `premium_type` + possibly use bot in a shared server
* Optional: Upgrade backend to use `/users/@me/guilds` or `/guilds/:id/members/:id` for extra detail

Would you like me to help update your backend API route to include `premium_type` and support Nitro detection?
