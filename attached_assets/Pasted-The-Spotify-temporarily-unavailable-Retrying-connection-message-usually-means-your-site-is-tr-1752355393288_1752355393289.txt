The “Spotify temporarily unavailable — Retrying connection...” message usually means your site is trying to connect to Spotify’s API but failing, often because of one or more of these reasons:

### Common causes and fixes for that error:

1. **Access Token expired or missing**

   * Spotify API tokens expire quickly (typically in 1 hour). If your site is using an old token without refreshing it, the API calls will fail.
   * Make sure you implement the **OAuth token refresh flow** properly to get new tokens when the old one expires.

2. **Incorrect or missing scopes**

   * When you request user authorization, your app needs the correct scopes, especially `user-read-currently-playing`. Without it, Spotify won’t allow the API call.
   * Double-check your OAuth scopes.

3. **CORS or network errors**

   * If your browser blocks requests due to CORS, the API call will fail.
   * Check browser console for CORS errors and fix your API proxy or server settings.

4. **Spotify API rate limiting or downtime**

   * Spotify occasionally throttles requests or has temporary outages.
   * Check [Spotify Status](https://status.spotify.com/) to see if there’s an ongoing issue.

5. **Refresh token not handled properly**

   * If you’re using the Authorization Code flow, you need to use the refresh token to get new access tokens without asking the user to log in again.
   * If your site doesn’t handle that, the token will expire and API calls fail.

### How to debug it yourself:

* Open your browser dev tools → **Console** tab and check for errors related to Spotify API calls.
* Look in the **Network** tab for requests to `https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing` and check the response status code and message.
* If you see 401 Unauthorized, your token is invalid or expired.
* Check your token acquisition code — are you refreshing tokens or prompting users to re-login?

### Quick fix suggestions:

* Re-login with Spotify on your site to get a fresh token.
* Implement or fix token refresh logic.
* Ensure your app has the proper OAuth scopes.
* Add error handling to retry the connection only a limited number of times before asking the user to re-authenticate.
