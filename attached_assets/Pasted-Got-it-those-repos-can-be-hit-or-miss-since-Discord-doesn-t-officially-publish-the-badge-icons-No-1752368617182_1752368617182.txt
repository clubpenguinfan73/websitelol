Got it — those repos can be hit or miss since Discord doesn’t officially publish the badge icons. No worries, I’ll help you get real, working Discord badge icons on your site.

### How to get **real Discord badge icons** that actually work:

#### 1. **Official Discord Badge Icons – Extract from Discord’s CDN**

Discord hosts all badge icons on their CDN. You can directly link to them like this:

```txt
https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/{badgeID}.png
```

But the problem is **Discord doesn’t publicly document badge IDs** for all badges. However, some IDs are known and stable, for example:

| Badge Name             | Badge ID | Example URL                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Discord Staff          | 1        | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/1.png)   |
| Discord Partner        | 2        | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/2.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/2.png)   |
| HypeSquad Events       | 3        | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/3.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/3.png)   |
| Bug Hunter Level 1     | 4        | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/4.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/4.png)   |
| Early Supporter        | 6        | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/6.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/6.png)   |
| Bug Hunter Level 2     | 9        | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/9.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/9.png)   |
| Verified Bot Developer | 14       | [https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/14.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/14.png) |

(These are just examples — some IDs may differ)

#### 2. **Use this mapping in your code**

```js
const badgeIconURLs = {
  STAFF: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/1.png",
  PARTNER: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/2.png",
  HYPESQUAD_EVENTS: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/3.png",
  BUG_HUNTER_LEVEL_1: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/4.png",
  EARLY_SUPPORTER: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/6.png",
  BUG_HUNTER_LEVEL_2: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/9.png",
  VERIFIED_BOT_DEVELOPER: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/badges/14.png",
};
```

Render the icons by mapping the badges you detect to these URLs.

#### 3. **Alternatively, use community SVG packs**

If you want scalable SVG badges (recommended), [here’s a community repo with SVG badges](https://github.com/NotQuiteDaily/Discord-Badges) that you can download and include in your project.

---

#### 4. **Example React snippet**

```jsx
const badges = getUserBadges(publicFlags); // returns array of badge keys

return (
  <div className="badge-container">
    {badges.map((badge) => (
      <img
        key={badge}
        src={badgeIconURLs[badge]}
        alt={badge}
        title={badge.replace(/_/g, " ")}
        className="discord-badge-icon"
      />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

### Summary

* Use Discord’s CDN hosted badge PNG URLs for simple fixes
* Or download SVGs from community repos for better visuals and control
* Map your user’s `public_flags` badges to these icons and render them dynamically
