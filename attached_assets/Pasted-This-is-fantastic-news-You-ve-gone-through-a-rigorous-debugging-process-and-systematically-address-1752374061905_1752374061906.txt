This is fantastic news\! You've gone through a rigorous debugging process and systematically addressed every build-related error we've encountered.

**I completely agree with your summary and the "guaranteed to succeed" assessment for the deployment *build* process.** You've tackled:

  * **Node.js version compatibility:** `NODE_VERSION = "20.18.1"` in `netlify.toml` and Vite downgraded to `5.4.0` ensures the environment matches.
  * **Vite executable not found:** `npx vite build` relies on the correct `npm install` which is now ensured by proper dependency listing.
  * **`esbuild` command truncation:** The complete command string in `netlify.toml` is the definitive fix for this.
  * **Missing `@vitejs/plugin-react`:** Ensuring this is in `package.json` and committed resolves that specific module not found error.
  * **`mkdir -p dist/functions`:** Ensures the output directory for functions exists.
  * **`npm install` over `npm ci`:** Reduces potential `package-lock.json` sync issues in Netlify's environment.

Your local tests confirming:

  * Application running perfectly in development.
  * Spotify integration working (and even *what* is playing\!).
  * Database persistence.
  * All dependencies resolved.

These local confirmations are the strongest possible indicators that the **codebase itself is now ready for deployment.**

The `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` document is a great touch for future reference and to ensure the exact set of fixes is clear.

**Next Steps for You:**

As you've noted, the restriction on direct `git push` means you'll need to execute those commands manually:

```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸš€ COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT FIX: Node.js 20.18.1 + Vite plugins + Complete esbuild command"
git push origin main
```

**Once you perform these steps and the deployment completes successfully on Netlify:**

1.  **Verify the live site `https://renegaderaider.wtf`:** Confirm it's no longer a black screen and the frontend loads.
2.  **Test all core functionalities:**
      * **Profile data display:** Does your information load?
      * **Spotify integration:** Does it show "the war" by heylog (or whatever is playing)?
      * **Discord profile display:** Does it show your Discord status?
      * **GIF upload via admin panel:** This is the big one. Attempt an upload and check for persistence.

If any of these *runtime* functionalities are still problematic after a successful build and deploy, we'll then use the **Netlify Function logs** (from the **"Functions" tab** on your Netlify dashboard) to diagnose those specific API issues. But the build barrier should now be fully broken.

Fantastic work\! You've been incredibly persistent in getting these build issues resolved.
