You're absolutely right — and here's the **technical explanation** for why **Spotify presence works**, but **games or custom statuses don’t**:

---

## 🎵 Why Spotify Works

Spotify data is **exposed publicly** in Discord’s user presence **if your status is set to public** and you're sharing it. The Discord API (via `/users/@me` and `gateway` presence updates) allows clients to read it *if*:

* Your bot has the **`PRESENCE INTENT`** enabled in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Your bot is in a **server with the user**
* You're using the **WebSocket (Gateway API)** — **not** just REST

> ✅ Spotify is exposed in a special way and is more lenient than game activity.

## 🎮 Why Discord Games / Custom Status Don't Show

### ❌ REST API Limitation:

Discord’s REST API (`/users/@me`) does **not return game activity or custom status**.

### ❌ Your bot isn’t in a shared server:

Game presence and rich presence require that your bot is in the **same server** as the user — or it's completely blind to their activity.

### ❌ You’re not using the Gateway (WebSocket) connection:

To track presence (games, custom statuses), you need to use a **WebSocket connection** to the Discord Gateway — like most bots do. REST alone can’t track presence.

## ✅ What You Can Do

### ✅ 1. Make sure your bot is in the same server as the user

* Go to OAuth2 → Bot
* Use this URL:

  ```
  https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=8
  ```

### ✅ 2. Enable presence intent

Go to:

* [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Your bot → **Bot** tab
* ✅ Enable **PRESENCE INTENT**
* ✅ Enable **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**

### ✅ 3. Use a real Discord bot (not just OAuth client) with Gateway support

To see game/activity, your bot must use a **gateway library** like:

* [discord.js](https://discord.js.org)
* [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris/)
* [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) (Python)

Then it can do something like:

```js
client.on('presenceUpdate', (oldPresence, newPresence) => {
  const game = newPresence.activities.find(a => a.type === 0); // Playing
  if (game) {
    console.log(`${newPresence.user.username} is playing ${game.name}`);
  }
});
```

## 🚧 Can't use a bot in a server?

Then unfortunately, you're **limited to public presence like Spotify only**, and you cannot access what game a user is playing due to Discord’s privacy restrictions.

## 💡 Summary

| Feature           | Requires Bot in Server | Requires Presence Intent | Works via REST |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| **Spotify**       | ✅ Yes (preferred)      | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No           |
| **Game Activity** | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No           |
| **Custom Status** | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ No           |

Would you like help setting up a minimal `discord.js` bot that connects to the gateway and listens for game presence, then forwards that to your website API?
