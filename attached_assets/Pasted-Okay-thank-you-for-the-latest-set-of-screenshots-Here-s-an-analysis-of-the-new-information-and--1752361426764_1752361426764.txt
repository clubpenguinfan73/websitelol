Okay, thank you for the latest set of screenshots.

Here's an analysis of the new information and what we need to focus on:

1.  **`image_9c43fb.png` and `image_90795c.png` (Browser Console Logs):**
    * These are **identical console logs** to what we've been seeing.
    * **Persistent Errors:**
        * `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON` from "Spotify API error".
        * `POST https://renegaderaider.wtf/.netlify/functions/api/profile 500 (Internal Server Error)`.
        * `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 () /netlify/functions/api/profile/1` (this confirms the 500 on the profile endpoint).
    * This is the critical part: The issues from the very beginning **are still present on your live site.** The client-side is forming the GIF data correctly, but the backend function is still crashing. The Spotify issue is also still active.

2.  **`image_9bd03c.jpg` (Spotify Display Comparison):**
    * Left side shows "Spotify Nothing playing".
    * Right side shows "Listening to Spotify GOD by 2bolllz".
    * This visually confirms the core problem: It works in one environment (your local preview, or a staging branch), but not on the live site. This strongly suggests environment variable or deployment differences.

3.  **`image_9bc478.png` (MongoDB Atlas Cluster Configuration):**
    * Shows `Cluster0` is named and you've selected `AWS` as the provider. This is fine, but doesn't tell us about the connection status.

4.  **`image_9b6de5.png` (MongoDB Atlas Cluster Overview - Connect/Add Data):**
    * Shows your `Cluster0` tab, with "Connect" and "Edit configuration" buttons. "Add data" options are available. This just indicates the cluster is up.

5.  **`image_9bc0f2.png` (MongoDB Atlas Connection - *Incorrect* Driver Selected):**
    * This is a **major problem**. You have **"Python" selected as the Driver.**
    * **Netlify Functions run Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript).** If you're trying to use a Python connection string in a JavaScript function, it will fail to connect, leading to a `500 Internal Server Error` in your Netlify Function logs.

6.  **`image_9bc3fa.png` (MongoDB Atlas Connect - "Choose a Connection Method"):**
    * This is the screen where you select how to connect. The correct option here is **"Drivers"** (the top option).

7.  **`image_90797e.png` (Client-Side Update Failed Message):**
    * "Update failed 500: Internal Error. ID: 01K00E161DYNWZ6GTN1RRZ292F"
    * This is a client-side error message that confirms the 500 status coming from your Netlify Function, as seen in the console.

### **SUMMARY of the Problem:**

The most glaring and confirmed issue is that your Netlify Functions, which are written in Node.js, are trying to connect to MongoDB Atlas using a connection string intended for a Python driver. This is a fundamental mismatch that will prevent any successful database connection from your functions.

Additionally, the Spotify error suggests environment variable problems (missing API keys/secrets) for that specific Netlify Function, causing it to return HTML.

### **CRITICAL ACTION PLAN: FIX THE DATABASE CONNECTION AND THEN THE SPOTIFY ISSUE**

You **must** perform these steps with extreme care and accuracy.

---

**PART A: Fix MongoDB Atlas Connection (Primary Cause of 500s for Profile/GIFs)**

1.  **Get the Correct Node.js Connection String:**
    * Go to your MongoDB Atlas Dashboard.
    * Click the **"Connect" button** for your `Cluster0`.
    * In the popup, select **"Connect your application."**
    * **THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP:** For "Select your driver and version":
        * **Driver:** Select **`Node.js`** from the dropdown.
        * **Version:** Select the **latest recommended version** (e.g., `4.7 or later`).
    * **Copy the entire connection string provided** in step 3 of that popup. It will look similar to:
        `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
    * **Crucially, replace `<username>` with the exact database username you created (e.g., `renegaderaider`) and `<password>` with the exact password for that database user.** **Double-check this password!**

2.  **Verify MongoDB Atlas Network Access:**
    * In MongoDB Atlas -> **"Security" -> "Network Access"** (left sidebar).
    * Ensure there's an IP address entry for **`0.0.0.0/0` ("Allow Access from Anywhere")** with a **"Status" of "Active"**. If it's pending, wait. If not there, add it.

3.  **Update Netlify Environment Variable:**
    * Go to your **Netlify Dashboard** ([app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)).
    * Select your **Site** (`renegaderaider.wtf`).
    * Go to **"Site settings" -> "Build & deploy" -> "Environment variables."**
    * Find the variable you're using for your MongoDB connection (e.g., `MONGO_URI`).
    * **EDIT its value and paste the ENTIRE, CORRECTED Node.js connection string from Step 1.1.** No typos, no extra spaces. It must be perfect.

4.  **Confirm `mongodb` Driver in Code/Dependencies:**
    * Ensure `mongodb` is listed in your `package.json` `dependencies`.
    * Ensure your Netlify Function code (`netlify/functions/api/profile.js`) uses `require('mongodb').MongoClient` or `import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb';` to connect.

**PART B: Fix Spotify "Nothing Playing" (Separate Issue, Same Root Cause)**

This is almost certainly an environment variable problem for your Spotify API keys.

1.  **Verify Spotify API Credentials on Netlify:**
    * In your **Netlify Dashboard -> Your Site -> Site settings -> Build & deploy -> Environment variables.**
    * **Carefully check the values for:**
        * `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
        * `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
        * `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
    * **These must EXACTLY match** what you have configured in your Spotify Developer Dashboard for your application. Even a single character difference will cause authentication to fail.

2.  **Examine Spotify Netlify Function Code:**
    * If the environment variables are correct, the issue lies in your Spotify-related Netlify Function code. It's likely attempting an API call (e.g., for an access token or currently playing song) that fails, and instead of returning a proper JSON error, it's returning HTML. Add more `console.log` statements in that function to see the raw response from Spotify's API before any JSON parsing.

**PART C: Redeploy and Check Netlify Function Logs (THE FINAL DIAGNOSTIC)**

1.  **Push your latest code changes to Git** to trigger a new Netlify deploy.
2.  Once deployed, **go to your live website** and **trigger the actions** that cause these errors (try to set a profile picture/background, refresh the page for Spotify).
3.  Go to your **Netlify Dashboard -> Your Site -> Functions.**
4.  **Click on `api/profile` and your Spotify-related function.**
5.  **Examine their latest logs.** This is where the *new* error messages (or success messages) will appear. You *should* see different errors now that you're using the correct Node.js connection string. If you still see connection errors, they will be more specific.

We must get past these fundamental connection/variable issues before any other parts of the application can work.
