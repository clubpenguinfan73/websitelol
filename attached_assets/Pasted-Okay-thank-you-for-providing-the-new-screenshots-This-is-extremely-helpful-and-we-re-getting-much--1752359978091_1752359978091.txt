Okay, thank you for providing the new screenshots! This is extremely helpful and we're getting much closer to diagnosing the exact problem.

Let's break down what these new images show:

1.  **`image_9c43fb.png` (Console Log):** This is the **exact same console log from before**. It *still* shows:
    * `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` for Spotify API calls.
    * `POST .../.netlify/functions/api/profile 500 (Internal Server Error)`.

    This means **the fundamental backend issues in your Netlify Functions are still unresolved.** The client-side is successfully reading the GIF, but your server-side function is crashing when it tries to handle it.

2.  **`image_9adf3f.png` and `image_9adf23.png` (MongoDB Atlas Connection String):**
    * This is **EXCELLENT!** You've successfully navigated to the **Node.js driver connection string** section in MongoDB Atlas.
    * **Yes, this is the correct connection string to use!**

    The string is: `mongodb+srv://renegaderaider:<db_password>@mzuvuzl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=meowing`

    **Crucial next step:** You **MUST replace `<db_password>`** with the *actual password* for the `renegaderaider` database user you created in MongoDB Atlas. This is the **most likely point of failure right now.**

---

### **Action Plan: Precision, Precision, Precision!**

The consistent errors mean the backend functions are still failing before they can even process the request or connect to the database. This is almost certainly due to an incorrect or missing environment variable in Netlify, or a permissions issue with MongoDB Atlas.

**Here's what you need to do, step-by-step, with absolute accuracy:**

---

### **Step 1: Get the FULL, CORRECT MongoDB Atlas Connection String**

1.  Take the string you just showed: `mongodb+srv://renegaderaider:<db_password>@mzuvuzl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=meowing`
2.  **Find the password for the `renegaderaider` database user** in your records (the one you saved when you created the user in MongoDB Atlas -> Database Access).
3.  **Replace `<db_password>`** in the connection string with that exact password.

    * **Example (DO NOT USE THIS PASSWORD - REPLACE WITH YOURS):**
        If your password was `MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd!`, the string would be:
        `mongodb+srv://renegaderaider:MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd!@mzuvuzl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=meowing`

### **Step 2: Update Netlify Environment Variables (THIS IS THE PRIMARY SUSPECT)**

1.  Go to your **Netlify Dashboard** ([app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/)).
2.  Select your **Site** (`renegaderaider.wtf`).
3.  In the top navigation, click **"Site settings."**
4.  In the left sidebar, under "Build & deploy," select **"Environment variables."**
5.  Find the variable you're using for your MongoDB connection string (it's often named `MONGO_URI` or `DB_CONNECTION_STRING`).
6.  **Click to edit its value and paste the ENTIRE, FULLY CORRECTED Node.js connection string from Step 1.**
    * **Crucially, double-check every single character.** A single typo, missing character, or extra space will cause the connection to fail. **The password inside this string must be exact.**

7.  **While you're there, quickly verify these again:**
    * `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
    * `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
    * `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`
    * Ensure they are present and correct. The `SyntaxError` for Spotify also suggests missing or incorrect backend environment variables for Spotify authentication, causing your Spotify function to crash and return HTML.

### **Step 3: Verify MongoDB Atlas Network Access (Permission)**

1.  In your MongoDB Atlas Dashboard, go to **"Network Access"** under the "Security" section (left sidebar).
2.  **Confirm that `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Access from Anywhere) is *Active*.** If it's pending, wait. If it's not there, add it. This is essential for Netlify Functions because they have dynamic IP addresses.

---

### **Step 4: Ensure `mongodb` Driver is in Your Netlify Functions**

1.  In your project's `package.json` (or the `package.json` specifically for your Netlify Functions if you have one), ensure `mongodb` is listed under `dependencies`.
    * If not, run `npm install mongodb` in your project root and commit the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` changes.

---

### **Step 5: Redeploy and Check Netlify Function Logs (THE MOST IMPORTANT DEBUGGING STEP)**

1.  After making all the above changes (especially updating the Netlify environment variable), **push your code to Git** to trigger a new Netlify deploy.
2.  Once deployed, **go to your live website** (`renegaderaider.wtf`).
3.  **Trigger the actions that cause the errors** (e.g., try to upload a PFP/background, wait for the Spotify section to try to load).
4.  **Immediately go to your Netlify Dashboard -> Your Site -> Functions.**
5.  **Click on `api/profile` and your Spotify-related function.**
6.  **Examine their logs closely.** Look for the *new* error messages, if any. The `500 Internal Server Error` will have a detailed stack trace in these logs, telling you *exactly* why your function is crashing (e.g., "authentication failed," "network timeout," "invalid JSON body," etc.).

**This step is absolutely crucial.** The generic `500` in your browser console tells you nothing, but the Netlify Function logs will give you the specific reason.

I suspect the `SyntaxError` for Spotify is also related to incorrect environment variables for its API keys/secrets on Netlify, causing your Spotify function to fail authentication on the backend and return an HTML error page instead of JSON.

Please focus on accurately performing these steps and sharing what the **Netlify Function logs** tell you. That's the information that will allow us to finally pinpoint the specific issue.
