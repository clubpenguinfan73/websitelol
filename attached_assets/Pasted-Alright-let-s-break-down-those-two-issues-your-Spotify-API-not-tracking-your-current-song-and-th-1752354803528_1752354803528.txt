Alright, let’s break down those two issues — your Spotify API not tracking your current song, and the GIF background not working on your site.

### 1. **Spotify API not tracking your current song**

Common causes why Spotify API integration to get your currently playing song doesn’t work:

* **Authentication / Token issues:**
  Spotify API requires an access token with the right scopes (like `user-read-currently-playing`).
  Tokens expire fast (usually in 1 hour). Are you refreshing the token properly?
* **CORS or request errors:**
  Check if your API requests are blocked by CORS or failing with 401/403 errors.
* **Incorrect API endpoint or request:**
  The endpoint to get currently playing track is:
  `GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/currently-playing`
  Make sure your request uses the right headers:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN  
  ```
* **User not playing anything:**
  If you’re not actively playing a song on Spotify, the API returns empty or no data.
* **Playback not accessible:**
  The API only tracks devices logged in with the same Spotify account and with active playback.

**How to debug:**

* Open browser dev tools → Network tab → look at Spotify API requests → check response and status codes.
* Check if the token is valid and has the right scopes.
* See if your code handles token refresh properly.

### 2. **GIF background not working**

If your GIF isn’t showing as the background, common causes:

* **CSS syntax or path issue:**
  Make sure your CSS has correct URL path to the GIF and the syntax is right:

  ```css
  background-image: url('path/to/your.gif');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  ```
* **GIF too large or blocked:**
  Large GIFs may load slowly or not at all, or your hosting might block GIFs.
* **Overlay or other CSS interfering:**
  Sometimes other elements or CSS properties (like `background-color`, z-index, opacity) hide or block the GIF.
* **Wrong file type or extension:**
  Double-check the GIF file is valid and accessible.

### How I can help next

* If you want, share your Spotify integration code or error messages.
* Share your CSS snippet where you set the GIF background.
* I can check your site live and inspect how those features are implemented.
* I can help you test API calls directly.
