If your site at [https://renegaderaider.wtf](https://renegaderaider.wtf) isn't displaying your Discord profile after logging in via OAuth2, here are some steps and checks to troubleshoot:

---

### 1. Confirm OAuth2 flow is working end-to-end

* When you visit your OAuth2 URL and authorize, you should be redirected to:
  `https://renegaderaider.wtf/discord/callback?code=...`

* Your backend must **exchange the `code` for an access token** by calling Discord’s token endpoint:

```http
POST https://discord.com/api/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&
grant_type=authorization_code&
code=CODE_FROM_CALLBACK&
redirect_uri=https://renegaderaider.wtf/discord/callback
```

* Then use the access token to call Discord API `/users/@me` to get your user profile.

---

### 2. Check your backend `/discord/callback` handler

* Is it correctly receiving the `code` param?
* Is it exchanging the code for a valid access token?
* Are you storing or returning the user data correctly for the frontend to display?

---

### 3. Check browser console and network tab

* Are there any errors (like 401 Unauthorized) when your frontend requests your backend API for the user profile?
* Is the profile API endpoint returning data or an error?

---

### 4. Verify your registered Redirect URI

* It must be exactly `https://renegaderaider.wtf/discord/callback` in your Discord developer portal under OAuth2.

---

### 5. Verify you’re properly passing the OAuth2 access token on API calls

* Discord API `/users/@me` requires `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.

---

### 6. Double-check your Discord user ID for correctness

* Your user ID: `142694270405574657`
* You can test with [Discord ID lookup](https://discord.id/)

---

### 7. Testing manual API call example:

Try this in your terminal with a valid access token (replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`):

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://discord.com/api/users/@me
```

You should get your user profile JSON.

If you want, you can share the relevant parts of your backend callback code or the frontend API request, and I can help pinpoint where it might be breaking!
