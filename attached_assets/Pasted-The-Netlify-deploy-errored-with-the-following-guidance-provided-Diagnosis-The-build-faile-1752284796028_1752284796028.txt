The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to a user error at [line 71](#L71) where the build script tried to list the contents of a directory `dist/functions/` that does not exist.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue:
1. Verify that the `dist/functions/` directory exists in your project. If it doesn't, create it or ensure it's being generated during the build process.
2. Update the build script to ensure it's correctly referencing the existing directories before attempting to list their contents.

After verifying the existence of the directory and updating the build script, trigger a new build to confirm the issue has been resolved.
