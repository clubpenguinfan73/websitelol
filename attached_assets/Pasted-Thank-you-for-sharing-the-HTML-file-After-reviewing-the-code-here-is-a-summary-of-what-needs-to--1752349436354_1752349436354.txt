Thank you for sharing the HTML file. After reviewing the code, here is a **summary of what needs to be fixed** to resolve the **blank black screen issue**:

### ✅ Summary of Problems & Fixes

#### 1. **External API Calls Are Likely Failing**

Your script makes two important fetch requests:

```js
fetch('/.netlify/functions/api/profile')
fetch('/.netlify/functions/api/links')
```

If these fail or return invalid responses, your site may appear empty except for the loading message. This is **the most likely reason** you're seeing a blank screen.

**Fix:**

* Check the **Netlify Functions** at `/.netlify/functions/api/profile` and `.../links`. Are they:

  * Deployed correctly?
  * Returning valid JSON?
  * Not throwing 404 or 500 errors?

You can test this by:

* Opening Developer Tools → Network tab → Reloading the page.
* Looking for failed `fetch` requests (red status codes).
* Opening the console for error messages (you might see `Profile loading failed:` or `Links loading failed:`).

#### 2. **No Fallback Content Rendered When Fetch Fails**

When the profile/links fetch fails, you log an error and show "Using default profile", but **you don’t actually populate default values.**

**Fix:**
Update the catch block to actually inject fallback HTML:

```js
document.getElementById('bio').textContent = 'Gamer. Streamer. Legend.';
document.getElementById('username').innerHTML = '<span class="char">r</span><span class="char">e</span>...';
```

#### 3. **Netlify Routing / Functions Setup**

Since you’re deploying on Netlify, confirm that:

* You have a `netlify.toml` with proper configuration for functions, like:

```toml
[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

* The functions are correctly placed and named (`api/profile.js`, `api/links.js`)
* They return responses like:

```js
return {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "renegade raider", bio: "..." })
};
```

#### 4. **Site Appears Visually Empty Until JavaScript Completes**

Because your HTML relies on JavaScript for *all* visible content (username, bio, links), if JS is blocked, fails, or takes time, the page is just a styled black background.

**Fix (optional but recommended):**
Add some basic default HTML inside `#username`, `#bio`, and `#links-section` so the site has content *even without JS*.

### ✅ What You Should Do Right Now

1. **Open Developer Tools (F12)**

   * Look at the **Console** for JS errors.
   * Look at the **Network tab** for failed requests (especially `/.netlify/functions/...`).
2. **Fix or mock your Netlify Functions**

   * If you haven’t created them yet, you must. These populate all dynamic content.
3. **Temporarily hardcode some test data**

   * In `loadProfile()` and `loadLinks()`, replace `fetch(...)` with hardcoded dummy data to see the site render.

Let me know if you want help:

* Writing a mock Netlify function (`api/profile.js`)
* Creating a fallback rendering system
* Or reviewing the deployment settings

This is a JS/API content-fetch issue — not a CSS or HTML structure problem.
