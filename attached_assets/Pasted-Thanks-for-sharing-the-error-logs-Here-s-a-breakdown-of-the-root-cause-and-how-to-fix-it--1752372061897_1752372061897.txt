Thanks for sharing the error logs. Here's a breakdown of the root cause and how to fix it.

---

### üîç **Error Summary**

The key lines are:

```
npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: vite@7.0.4
failed to load config from /opt/build/repo/vite.config.ts
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite'
```

### üö® **Root Cause**

The build is failing because Netlify is trying to run `npx vite build`, but the `vite` package is **not installed locally** or is not recognized during the build. Even though it mentions installing `vite@7.0.4`, it seems the install is not effective in the Netlify environment before `vite.config.ts` is evaluated.

---

### ‚úÖ **Fixes**

#### 1. **Add `vite` as a `devDependency`**

Make sure Vite is properly installed and listed in your `package.json`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite
```

Check your `package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^4.5.0"  // Use a known stable version
}
```

> ‚ùó Avoid relying on implicit `npx vite` installs, especially in CI/CD environments like Netlify.

---

#### 2. **Ensure Proper `vite.config.ts` Support**

Netlify might be using an older Node version that doesn‚Äôt support TypeScript config files out of the box. You can either:

* Rename `vite.config.ts` to `vite.config.js` and convert the config to JS, **or**
* Add a build step that transpiles your TypeScript config file before running `vite`.

Alternatively, ensure Vite is installed so it can properly handle `.ts` config files.

---

#### 3. **Pin Node Version (Optional but Helpful)**

In your project root, add a `.nvmrc` or set this in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

(Adjust the version as needed.)

---

#### 4. **Final `netlify.toml` Sample**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "dist"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

Let me know if you want help modifying your `vite.config.ts`, or inspecting your `package.json`.
