It sounds like you're encountering issues with GIFs not displaying correctly on your website, renegaderaider.wtf, particularly when trying to use them as a profile picture (PFP) and background.

To help you troubleshoot, here are some common reasons why GIFs might not be working on a website and how you can address them:

**1. Incorrect File Paths/URLs:**

  * **Problem:** The most frequent cause. If the `src` attribute for your `<img>` tag (for the PFP) or the `url()` in your CSS `background-image` property (for the background) is incorrect, the browser won't find the GIF.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Double-check the file path:** Is the GIF in the same directory as your HTML file? Or is it in a subfolder? Make sure the path reflects its actual location.
      * **Absolute vs. Relative Paths:**
          * **Relative:** `images/mygif.gif` (if `images` is a folder in the same directory as your HTML).
          * **Absolute:** `https://yourwebsite.com/images/mygif.gif` (if hosted elsewhere or you want to be very specific).
      * **Case Sensitivity:** File systems on web servers are often case-sensitive. `MyGif.gif` is different from `mygif.gif`. Ensure your paths match the exact case of your filenames.

**2. Large File Size:**

  * **Problem:** GIFs, especially high-quality or long ones, can be very large. Large file sizes can lead to slow loading times, or in some cases, the browser might not even fully load them, appearing as if they're not working.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Optimize your GIFs:**
          * Use online GIF optimizers (e.g., EZgif.com, Giphy's GIF Maker) to reduce file size without losing too much quality.
          * Consider reducing the number of frames or the color palette.
          * Reduce dimensions (width and height) if possible.

**3. Incorrect CSS Properties (for Background GIF):**

  * **Problem:** If you're using CSS for the background GIF, certain properties might be overriding it or preventing it from displaying correctly.
  * **Solution:**
      * **`background-image`:** Make sure you're using `background-image: url('path/to/your.gif');`
      * **`background-repeat`:** If your GIF is small and you only want it to appear once, use `background-repeat: no-repeat;`. If you want it to tile, use `repeat`.
      * **`background-size`:**
          * `cover`: Scales the background image to cover the entire container, even if it has to crop some parts.
          * `contain`: Scales the background image to be as large as possible without cropping or stretching the image.
          * You can also use pixel values or percentages (e.g., `background-size: 100% 100%;`).
      * **`background-position`:** Controls where the background image is placed (e.g., `center center`).
      * **Parent Element Dimensions:** Ensure the element you're applying the background to has defined dimensions (width and height) in CSS. If it's empty or has `height: 0;`, the background won't be visible.

**4. GIF Corruption or Invalid Format:**

  * **Problem:** The GIF file itself might be corrupted or not a valid GIF format.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Test the GIF directly:** Try opening the GIF file directly in your web browser (drag and drop it into a new tab) or any image viewer on your computer. If it doesn't play there, the GIF file is the issue.
      * **Re-download/Re-create:** Try downloading the GIF again from its source or re-creating it.

**5. Browser Caching Issues:**

  * **Problem:** Your browser might be serving an old, cached version of your website that doesn't include the updated GIF.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Hard Refresh:**
          * Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + F5` or `Shift + F5`
          * Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
      * **Clear Browser Cache:** Go into your browser settings and clear your cache and cookies.

**6. HTML Structure for PFP:**

  * **Problem:** For a PFP, you're likely using an `<img>` tag. Incorrect usage can prevent it from displaying.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Basic `<img>` tag:**
        ```html
        <img src="path/to/your/pfp.gif" alt="Your Profile Picture">
        ```
      * **Styling:** Ensure any CSS applied to the `<img>` tag or its parent isn't setting `display: none;`, `opacity: 0;`, or extremely small `width`/`height`.

**7. Network Issues/Blocked Content:**

  * **Problem:** Rarely, a firewall, ad-blocker, or network setting might be blocking the GIF from loading.
  * **Solution:**
      * **Disable Ad-blocker:** Temporarily disable any ad-blockers or browser extensions.
      * **Check Console:** Open your browser's developer console (F12, then go to the "Console" or "Network" tab) for any error messages related to loading the GIF.

**To help me give you more specific advice, please provide:**

  * **The exact HTML code** you're using for your PFP.
  * **The exact CSS code** you're using for your background.
  * **The specific location/path** where you've uploaded your GIF files on your server.
  * **Any error messages** you see in your browser's developer console (press F12 to open it, then look at the "Console" and "Network" tabs).
