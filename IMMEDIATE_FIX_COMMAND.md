# IMMEDIATE FIX - Command Truncation Issue - July 13, 2025

## Problem Diagnosed
The esbuild command is being truncated from `--format=esm --outfile=dist/functions/api.js` to just `--for` during Netlify deployment.

## Root Cause
The command string in netlify.toml is somehow being truncated during deployment, causing the esbuild command to be incomplete.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Reverted to npm install
- Changed back from `npm ci` to `npm install` for better compatibility
- Added back `mkdir -p dist/functions` to ensure directory exists

### 2. Complete Build Command
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npx vite build && mkdir -p dist/functions && npx esbuild netlify/functions/mongo-api.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outfile=dist/functions/api.js"
  publish = "dist/public"
  environment = { NODE_VERSION = "20.18.1" }
```

### 3. Verification
- âœ… mongo-api.ts exists in netlify/functions/
- âœ… All esbuild flags are complete
- âœ… Single line command with no line breaks
- âœ… Proper quotes around command string

## Critical Points
1. **Complete command**: Full `--format=esm --outfile=dist/functions/api.js` included
2. **No line breaks**: Command is single continuous line
3. **Correct file path**: `netlify/functions/mongo-api.ts` confirmed to exist
4. **mkdir added**: Ensures dist/functions directory exists

## Deploy Command
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX: Complete esbuild command with all flags"
git push origin main
```

This should resolve the command truncation issue that was causing the build to fail with incomplete esbuild arguments.
