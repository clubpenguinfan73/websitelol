# IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Restore Full React App

## Current Status
- ✅ Black screen is FIXED (site loads)
- ❌ Only showing basic version instead of your complete app
- ✅ All APIs working perfectly (Discord, Spotify, Profile, Links)
- ✅ React app runs perfectly in development

## The Issue
The current live site shows the emergency fix HTML instead of your full React application with all the advanced features.

## Quick Fix - Deploy the React App

### Option 1: Using the Working Development Build
Your React app is fully functional. Here's how to deploy it:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Replace the current `index.html`** with the React version from `client/index.html`
3. **Commit and push**
4. **Netlify will build and deploy automatically**

### Option 2: Manual Deploy (If GitHub auto-build fails)
1. **Download the entire `client` folder**
2. **Upload to Netlify manually**
3. **Set build command**: `npm run build`
4. **Set publish directory**: `dist`
