# Manual GitHub Push Commands - July 13, 2025

## Git Lock File Issue
The automated git commands are blocked by a persistent lock file. Here are the manual commands to push your deployment fixes:

## Manual Push Steps

### 1. Open Terminal and Navigate to Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### 2. Remove Lock File (if needed)
```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

### 3. Add All Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### 4. Commit with Message
```bash
git commit -m "ðŸš€ Final production deployment - Node fix, Vite build, Admin persistence"
```

### 5. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (if needed)
If the push fails due to previous issues:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## Files Ready for Deployment
The following critical fixes are ready:

### Updated Files:
- `netlify.toml` - Fixed Node.js version and Vite build command
- `replit.md` - Updated with deployment status
