# Deploy Admin Panel Fix - July 13, 2025

## Current Status
✅ **Fix Applied**: Admin panel persistence issue fixed in netlify.toml
✅ **Commits Ready**: 3 commits ahead of origin/main ready to deploy
✅ **MongoDB Integration**: Using mongo-api.ts function for proper database storage

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Manual Git Push (Recommended)
Open terminal and run:
```bash
git push origin main
```

If the push fails due to sensitive data detection, try:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

### Option 2: Direct Netlify Deploy
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site (renegaderaider.wtf)
3. Click "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Deploy site" → "Deploy site"
5. Select "Deploy from branch"
6. Choose main branch
7. Click "Deploy"

### Option 3: Create New Deployment
If git push continues to fail:
1. Download/zip your current code
2. Go to Netlify dashboard
3. Drag and drop the zip file for manual deployment
4. Or use Netlify CLI: `netlify deploy --prod`

## What Will Be Fixed After Deployment
- ✅ Admin panel changes will persist to MongoDB database
- ✅ Profile updates (username, bio, effects) will save permanently
- ✅ Link management (add/edit/delete) will work correctly
- ✅ Image uploads will save to database
- ✅ All settings will survive page refreshes

## Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in Netlify:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` - Working
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` - Working  
- `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` - Working
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` - Set
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` - Set
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Set
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Set

## Test After Deployment
1. Visit https://renegaderaider.wtf
2. Open admin panel
3. Login: Username `Cat`, Password `Cat@Renagde.wtf73`
4. Change username to something else
5. Refresh page - change should persist
6. Success! Admin panel is now working properly

## Technical Details
The fix changes `netlify.toml` from using `api-fixed.ts` (static data) to `mongo-api.ts` (database integration). This ensures all admin panel changes are saved to your MongoDB Atlas database permanently.

Your admin panel will now work exactly as intended with full persistence!
