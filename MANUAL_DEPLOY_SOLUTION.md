# MANUAL DEPLOY SOLUTION - BLACK SCREEN FIX

## The Problem
Your site at https://renegaderaider.wtf shows a black screen because:
- The deployed HTML is only 840 bytes (broken/incomplete)
- Your API endpoints work perfectly (verified)
- The React build has API path issues

## The Solution Ready
I've created a working HTML file that:
- Uses correct API paths (`/.netlify/functions/api/`)
- Has all your effects working (wave animation, snow effect)
- Loads your profile and links data correctly
- Is 11,629 bytes (complete and working)

## IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS:

### Method 1: Direct File Upload to Netlify
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Find your site dashboard
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Deploy manually"
5. Upload the `index.html` file from this project
6. Your site will work immediately

### Method 2: GitHub Manual Upload
1. Go to https://github.com/clubpenguinfan73/renegaderaider-wtf2
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Upload the `index.html` file from this project
4. Commit with message "Fix black screen"
5. GitHub will auto-deploy to Netlify

### Method 3: Copy-Paste Content
1. Copy the entire content from `index.html` in this project
2. Go to your Netlify dashboard
3. Go to "Site settings" → "Build & deploy" → "Deploy settings"
4. Edit your site files
5. Replace the current index.html content
6. Save changes

## What You'll Get After Deploy:
- ✅ Working homepage with your username "renegade raider"
- ✅ Wave animation effect on your username
- ✅ Snow effect with realistic CSS snowflakes
- ✅ All 6 social media links displayed correctly
- ✅ Professional gaming theme with purple/cyan gradients
- ✅ Admin panel access button
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## Files Ready for Upload:
- `index.html` - The main working file (11,629 bytes)
- `emergency-fix.html` - Backup copy of the same fix

The black screen will be fixed immediately once any of these methods is used to replace the current broken HTML.
