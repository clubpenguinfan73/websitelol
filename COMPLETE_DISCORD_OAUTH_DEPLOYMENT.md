# Complete Discord OAuth2 Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your Discord OAuth is working, but your production site shows a 404 when Discord redirects to `/discord/callback`. This is because the Netlify function needs to handle the callback path correctly.

## The Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Netlify Function Path Handling
Updated `netlify/functions/api.ts` to handle both:
- `/api/discord/callback` (API route)
- `/discord/callback` (direct callback route)

### 2. Added Default Environment Variables
Added fallback values for Discord credentials in case environment variables aren't set:
```javascript
const CLIENT_ID = process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID || '1393354181536120966';
const CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET || 'DVCv0_dyChk8XGjfVKHTxMy5rOgi4EG2';
```

### 3. Complete Environment Variables for Netlify

Add these to your Netlify environment variables:
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=MTM5MzM1NDE4MTUzNjEyMDk2Ng.G695FJ.qaOhhV9Ac1wt7eSJFuGOIn02_K-6WStjqWvILs
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1393354181536120966
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=DVCv0_dyChk8XGjfVKHTxMy5rOgi4EG2
```

### 4. OAuth Flow Now Works As:
1. User clicks Discord login button
2. Redirects to Discord for authorization
3. Discord redirects back to: `https://renegaderaider.wtf/discord/callback?code=...`
4. Netlify function handles the callback, exchanges code for token
5. Fetches user profile and displays success page
6. Stores user data in localStorage
7. Auto-redirects to main site

## Deploy Commands

```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
git push origin main
```

## Test Discord OAuth After Deployment

1. Visit: `https://renegaderaider.wtf/discord-login-helper.html`
2. Click "Login with Discord"
3. Authorize the application
4. You should see the success page with your Discord profile
5. Auto-redirect to your main site with stored user data

## Discord Application Setup

Make sure your Discord application has the redirect URI set to:
```
https://renegaderaider.wtf/discord/callback
```

## Expected Success Flow

After deployment, when someone uses Discord OAuth:
1. They'll see a beautiful success page with their Discord avatar
2. User data will be stored in localStorage
3. They'll be redirected to your main site after 5 seconds
4. Your main app can access the stored Discord user data

The 404 error will be resolved once you deploy this fix!
