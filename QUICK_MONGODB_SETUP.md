# Your MongoDB Setup - Ready to Go!

## Your Database Credentials:
- **Username**: `renegaderaider`
- **Password**: `Cat@Renagde.wtf73`
- **Database**: `renegade_db`

## Your Connection String Template:
```
mongodb+srv://renegaderaider:Cat%40Renagde.wtf73@YOUR_CLUSTER_URL/renegade_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
*Note: The @ symbol is URL encoded as %40*

## Next Steps:

### 1. Get Your Cluster URL (2 minutes)
In MongoDB Atlas:
1. Click "Connect" on your cluster
2. Choose "Connect your application"
3. Copy the connection string
4. Replace the username/password with your credentials above

### 2. Add to Netlify (1 minute)
1. Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site settings
2. Build & deploy → Environment variables
3. Add variable:
   - **Key**: `MONGO_URI`
   - **Value**: Your complete connection string

### 3. Test the Migration (1 minute)
I've already exported your current data:
- `profile_backup.json` - Your profile data
- `links_backup.json` - Your links data

### 4. Deploy and Import (2 minutes)
```bash
# Deploy the MongoDB functions
git add -A
git commit -m "Add MongoDB Atlas integration"
git push origin main

# Test the new MongoDB endpoints
curl "https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/api-mongo/profile"
curl "https://YOUR-SITE.netlify.app/api-mongo/links"
```

### 5. Switch to MongoDB (1 minute)
When ready, update your `netlify.toml`:
```toml
# Change from:
from = "/api/*"
to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"

# To:
from = "/api/*"
to = "/.netlify/functions/mongo-api/:splat"
```

## Your Data is Ready:
✅ Profile exported: Username "Cat", bio "meowing all day"
✅ Links exported: 1 link (Last.fm)
✅ MongoDB functions created
✅ Migration script ready

## Benefits After Migration:
- Better performance with document-based storage
- Automatic scaling with MongoDB Atlas
- Global distribution and backups
- Perfect for serverless Netlify Functions
- Future-ready for additional features

You're all set! Just get your cluster URL and add it to Netlify environment variables.
