# Quick Deployment Guide - Finding Cache Clear Option

## Where to Find "Clear Cache" in Netlify

### Option 1: Site Settings
1. **Netlify Dashboard** → **Your Site** → **Site settings**
2. **Build & deploy** (left sidebar)
3. **Post processing** section
4. Look for **"Clear cache and deploy site"** button

### Option 2: Deploys Tab
1. **Netlify Dashboard** → **Your Site** → **Deploys**
2. **Site settings** → **Build & deploy**
3. **Clear cache** button (may be under "Options" or "More")

### Option 3: If You Can't Find Cache Clear
**Skip the cache step - just upload the fix directly:**

1. **Go to Deploys tab**
2. **Click "Deploy manually"**
3. **Choose "Deploy folder"**
4. **Create new folder with `index.html`**
5. **Upload and deploy**

## Alternative: Direct File Upload

If cache clearing isn't available:

1. **Download** `ultimate-fix.html` from your project
2. **Create empty folder** on your computer
3. **Copy the file** into the folder
4. **Rename to** `index.html`
5. **Drag folder** to Netlify deploy area
6. **Deploy**

## The file will override everything and work immediately

The new `index.html` will completely replace the broken React version. Since it's a totally different file, it bypasses cache issues automatically.

## After Upload
1. Visit https://renegaderaider.wtf
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+F5)
3. Site should load with your profile data or defaults

**No cache clearing needed - the fix works regardless!**
